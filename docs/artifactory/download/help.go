func GetArguments() string {
	return `	source pattern
		Specifies the source path in Artifactory, from which the artifacts should be downloaded,
		in the following format: <repository name>/<repository path>. You can use wildcards to specify multiple artifacts.

	target pattern
		The second argument is optional and specifies the local file system target path.
		If the target path ends with a slash, the path is assumed to be a directory.
		For example, if you specify the target as "repo-name/a/b/", then "b" is assumed to be a directory into which files should be downloaded.
		If there is no terminal slash, the target path is assumed to be a file to which the downloaded file should be renamed.
		For example, if you specify the target as "a/b", the downloaded file is renamed to "b".
		For flexibility in specifying the target path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2} which are replaced by corresponding
		tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis.`
